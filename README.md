# Sales-Analysis
This project is a detailed **Sales Performance and Strategy Audit**. It analyzes retail data using Python to identify top-performing categories and regions, while simultaneously pinpointing loss centers. The study provides a data-backed roadmap for profit optimization, operational streamlining, and strategic resource allocation across the business.

This repository contains the analysis and strategic recommendations derived from a deep-dive audit across two core business areas: Retail Sales Performance. The project utilizes Python (Pandas) for data analysis to identify key performance drivers, profit leaks, and future growth opportunities.

## **Project Goals**

The primary objectives of this project were to:

- **Audit Profitability**: Determine the most (and least) profitable product categories and geographical regions using Average Profit per Order and Profit Margin.\
- **Identify Operational Leaks**: Pinpoint areas of significant profit loss (e.g., loss-making states like Punjab).
- **Evaluate Target Setting**: Assess the efficiency of the month-over-month (MoM) sales target planning process.

## 📈 **Sales Analysis Overview**
#### Category Performance Analysis

The analysis focuses on **unit economics** to explain performance differences:

| Category | Performance Metric | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Electronics** | Highest Avg. Profit per Order (₹51.44) | Success due to **high pricing power** and **low cost-to-serve (CTS)** relative to revenue. |
| **Furniture** | Lowest Profit Margin (1.81%) | Underperformance due to **commoditization** and high **logistical/fulfillment costs**. |

**Regional Prioritization**

Geographical performance was evaluated based on the alignment of sales volume and profitability:
- **Stop the Bleeding**: Immediate action is needed in Punjab (negative profit/loss leader).
- **Improve Efficiency**: **Madhya Pradesh** (high volume, moderate efficiency) requires a margin restoration audit (discounting, shipping costs).
- **Scale Success**: Maharashtra (highest Avg. Profit per Order at ₹68.62) is the most efficient market and should receive focused investment.

## 📦 **Key Deliverables**
- Data Analysis Scripts: Python code snippets for calculating key performance indicators (KPIs) like Total Sales, Profit Margin, and MoM Target Change.
- Performance Summary: Tables summarizing Category Performance and Regional Disparities.
